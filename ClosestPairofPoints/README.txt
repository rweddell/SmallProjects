Rob Weddell's ClosestPairOfPoints file can be compiled as

javac *.java   or   javac ClosestPairOfPoints.java


To apply it to a text file of integer pairs: 


java ClosestPairOfPoints 10points.txt (or whichever file is used)


It can also be run without a text file, and will generate a list of 10 points.
It will then find the closest pair of points of the randomly generated list.
